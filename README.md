Background:
Gary's Adventure is a 2D interactive puzzle game where Gary the snail is lost underwater. The main objective of the game is to help Gary get to home to Spongebob in Bikini Bottom. 

There are 6 grids in a 2x3 formation in every scene which can be moved around to help Gary get from the starting grid to the grid where the whirlpool is at. Each whirlpool leads to the next scene/level. Gary moves in one fixed direction until he hits an obstacle, where he will either lose a life (alien plant) or start moving in the opposite direction (rock). When Gary walks to a hole in the ground, he will either fall to the grid right below, or in the absence of a grid below, lose a life.

The game intends to introduce functionalities slowly to allow users to get the hang of it. There will be approximately 5-10 levels in this game.

Functionalities:
1. Users will be able to swap the position of two grids by clicking consecutively on both grids. 
2. Locked grids cannot be moved to any other position.
3. Obstacles that cause the character to lose their lives will result in the level restarting.
4. A rule page will also be provided to the users as follows:

Help Gary get back home! Swap the position of grids by clicking consecutively on two grids, while making use of, or avoiding some obstacles: 
- Rock: Changes the direction that Gary is moving in.
- Jellyfish: Zaps Gary (lose a life)
- Hole in the Ground: Gary falls through the ground (either drops to the grid below; or loses a life if there are no grids below the hole)
